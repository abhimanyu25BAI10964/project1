Restaurant Ordering System (Python)

This is a simple Python project where a customer can order food from a menu.
It takes input from the user, adds the bill, and shows a final summary at the end.
I made this to practice dictionaries, loops, if-else conditions, and basic logic.


# Features

* Shows a menu with prices
* User can order multiple items
* Quantity option
* Removes unavailable items
* Option to remove items before paying
* 10% discount if the bill is above ₹500
* Final bill summary with total amount


# How It Works

1. The program shows the available menu.


2. The user types what they want to order.


3. If the item exists, it's added to the bill.


4. The user can keep ordering until they type exit.


5. Before the bill is printed, the user gets a chance to remove an item.


6. If the total price is above ₹500, a discount is applied.


7. The final total is displayed at the end.


# Concepts Used

Dictionaries

Loops (while)

Conditionals (if/else)

Variables & user input

String formatting (f-strings)

# Output Example

welcome to our restaurant
pizza added to your order
do you want something else? yes
burger added
do you want something else? no

Final Bill:
pizza x1 = 180
burger x1 = 100

discount applied: Rs28
total to pay: Rs252
